# Trinity
A basic HTML homepage in a command-line Matrix-esque style that links into various services and websites.

This was designed to act as a homepage that acts as a portal into all of the services hosted in my home - files, media etc.

Replace the URLs in the code to your the URLs or IP addresses hosting services you want to link to.
