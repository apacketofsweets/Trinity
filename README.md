# Trinity
A basic HTML homepage in a command-line Matrix-esque style that links into various services and websites.

This was designed to act as a homepage that acts as a portal into all of the services hosted in my home - files, media etc. To use this on your own web server, replace the URLs in the code to your the URLs or IP addresses hosting services you want to link to. This also works using Github and Amazon AWS S3's built-in web hosting services too.
